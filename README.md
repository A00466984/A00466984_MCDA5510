Hello,
I am Shweta Dalal pursuing Masters in Computing and Data Analytics in Saint Mary's university. I am 23 year old having major interests in computer programming, watching movies, gaming, reading and travelling. I have a family of four; my mom, dad, younger sister and I. My personality is cheerful and very easygoing and I love to spend time with my family and friends. 
What led me to choose this course is my previos work experience as Data analyst and Business Intelligence engineer and my eagerness to further explore this field and grow opportunities in my career.

One fun fact about me is I am both right and left handed. Though more of a right one but still do many things with left like eating, playing badminton, sometimes writing.

I and my fellow groupmates of my current masters program share quiet similar interests one of the major being movies. We three are quiet fond of watching movies as a source of entertainment and never miss out a chance to watch one.
